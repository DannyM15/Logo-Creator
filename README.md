# Logo-Creator 

This project allows its users to create a SVG logo by entering the proper infomration in their fields. 3 letters followed by picking colors and the shape of the background.  This project posed many challenges such as creating different classes, inheriting those classes, and testing.  What I learned the most from this project is the testing model and making sure classes are being exported.
